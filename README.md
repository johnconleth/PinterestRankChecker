# PinterestRankChecker
Takes Keywords and finds if Pinterest has a page one rank in Google for that keyword.

If Pinterest does have a page one rank - the title(s) of the results are copied.

PinterestRankChecker also gets the number of search results for Pinterest.com using the keyword,
this gives us an idea of how popular or how many pins/boards there are on Pinterest for this keyword.

# INSTALL
Download the exe file and run it to install the program. If you have issues installing the program or running it, your system might require Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 redistributable to be installed. Google it and install it on your machine.

This software works on Windows ONLY! 

# USAGE
Copy and paste a list of keywords into the KEYWORDS field (one per line).

Click Run.

Your results will appear here, click on the text, select all the text (Ctrl A), copy (Ctrl C) and then paste the results into Excel etc.

# NOTES
You can change the browser setting in the Tools menu but there is no need when searching Pinterest.

The Private Browser tab works but has some bugs like not being able to open links in new tab etc. - Use only if you need it!
